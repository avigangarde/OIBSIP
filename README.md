# TASK 1- UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project. 

# Task-2 CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,
features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price
prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn
how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

# Task-3 EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let’s get
started!
