# TASK 1- UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

"Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which represents the proportion of individuals who are jobless within the total labor force. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a significant surge in the unemployment rate, making the analysis of this metric an excellent opportunity for a data science project."

# Task-2 CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

"The valuation of a car is influenced by numerous factors, including the brand's reputation, the car's features, horsepower, mileage, and various other considerations. Predicting car prices represents a significant research field within machine learning. If you are interested in acquiring the skills to develop a car price prediction model, this project offers an ideal opportunity for learning."

# Task-3 EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

"We have all experienced the annoyance of receiving spam emails. Spam mail, also known as junk mail, refers to unsolicited emails sent to a large number of recipients. These messages often contain obscure content, scams, or even more concerning, phishing attempts.
In this project, you can leverage Python to construct an email spam detector. By utilizing machine learning techniques, you will train the spam detector to identify and categorize emails as either spam or non-spam. Let's commence this exciting endeavor!"
